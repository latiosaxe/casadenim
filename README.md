# ðŸš€ Shopify Starter Theme + TailwindCSS with PurgeCSS

**First of all, big thank your for guys at The Couch for creating Shopify development toolkit called [Slater](https://github.com/the-couch/slater)**

I wanted to use Slater and TailwindCSS but couldn't make that work together. I had a project on the table with a start date NOW and decided to create this little temporary monster.

I took the [Slater theme](https://github.com/the-couch/slater), integrated it with TailwindCSS + PurgeCSS and rewrite most of the markup to use css classes from TailwindCSS.

Note: the theme needs some love and it's still work in progress.
